			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p class="meta">Last updated: September 2, 2025</p>

			<p>Welcome to Funterest (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, stores, and shares information when you install or use Funterest. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

			<h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
			<h3>1.1 Data collected automatically</h3>
			<p>Funterest does not require personal accounts. The App may access or process the following types of information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Activity suggestions</strong>: The App fetches activity suggestions from the public <a href="https://bored.api.lewagon.com/">Bored API</a>. Those suggestions are non-personal content such as activity text, category, number of participants, links and other metadata.</li>
				<li><strong>Device & usage data</strong> (limited): basic, non-identifying usage details may be stored locally to improve app behavior (for example caching, last-used category). The App does not transmit personal device identifiers to third-party analytics services by default.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>1.2 Data you provide</h3>
			<p>You may optionally save activities, mark favorites, or allow the App to schedule notifications. Any data you save in the App (favorites, recent history) is stored locally on your device using local storage.</p>

			<h2>2. How we use information</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide activity suggestions and category filtering.</li>
				<li>Cache activity data locally for faster loading and offline access.</li>
				<li>Deliver optional daily reminders via local notifications if you grant notification permission.</li>
				<li>Troubleshooting and improving the App (local logs only, no external analytics by default).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. Local storage</h2>
			<p>Funterest uses local storage (Get Storage) on your device to save recent activity history, favorites, and cached API results. This data stays on your device unless you choose to share it manually. Clearing the app data or uninstalling the app will remove locally stored information.</p>

			<h2>4. Notifications & permissions</h2>
			<p>The App may request permission to send you notifications. Notifications are optional; you can enable or disable them in the App or in your device settings. The App only uses the permission to schedule and display local reminders. We do not share your notification settings with third parties.</p>

			<h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
			<p>Funterest obtains activity data from the <a href="https://bored.api.lewagon.com/">Bored API</a>. The Bored API is a third-party service; please review their policies for details about their data handling. Other libraries used in the App (for example GetX, HTTP client, timezone utilities, permission handler) are open-source libraries included only to provide app functionality.</p>

			<h2>6. Analytics</h2>
			<p>The current App distribution does not include third-party analytics or crash-reporting SDKs by default. If analytics tools are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated and you will be informed via this page and app release notes.</p>

			<h2>7. Children</h2>
			<p>Funterest is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will delete the data as necessary.</p>

			<h2>8. Data security</h2>
			<p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect local data on the device. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. Please protect your device with standard security practices.</p>

			<h2>9. Data sharing & retention</h2>
			<p>Funterest does not sell or rent personal information. Local data is retained on your device until you clear it or uninstall the App. We only share data with third parties when required by law or to provide functionality you explicitly enable (for example, sharing an activity via another app).</p>

			<h2>10. International transfers</h2>
			<p>The App may communicate with services hosted internationally (for example the Bored API). By using the App, you agree that data transfers across borders may occur for functionality described above.</p>

			<h2>11. Your rights</h2>
			<p>You can control and delete the data stored by the App by using the in-app controls (where provided), clearing the app data from your device settings, or uninstalling the App. To request assistance or data removal information, contact us using the details below.</p>

			<h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
			<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post an updated version here and include the updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

			<h2>13. Contact</h2>
